# Day Care Management

What is this? Glad you asked, this is a day care management system. It is in version 1.0 right now but I am working on making that a better, faster, and more efficient app.

## How it works

* First you log-in with the test login (User: mdvclifton Pass: Jesus)
* Then from there, you can look at the schedules, search up students, mark them absent or present, look at attendence reports etc.

## What to expect in the future

* Soon, this page will be more stylish.
* It will have a emailing system for sending parents alerts regarding class or any last minute things.
* Will have photos displayed with the children so you can easy identify which child is which.
* And more....
